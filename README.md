# Time-Series_forecast
This repositary provides basic codes for time series forecasting in R and Python.<br />
You can try these codes with some simple data and observe how the results are varying for different algorithms.<br />
You can apply different algorithms based on the type of seasonality present in the data. For example, you can use additive_seasonality.py, if the type of seasonality is additive and multipilicative_seasonality.py if the type of seasonality is multipicative.
