# Time-Series_forecast
This repositary provides basic codes for time series forecasting in R and Python.
You can try these codes with some simple data and observe how the results are varying for different algorithms.
You can apply different algorithms based on the type of seasonality present in the data. For example, you can use additive_seasonality.py, if the type of seasonality is additive and multipilicative_seasonality.py if the type of seasonality is multipicative.
